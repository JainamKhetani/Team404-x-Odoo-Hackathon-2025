# ðŸš€ Team 404 x Odoo Hackathon 2025

# Skill Swap Platform 

**Overview:** 
Develop a Skill Swap Platform â€” a mini application that enables users to list their skills and 
request others in return

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Team 404** for the **Odoo Hackathon 2025**!  
This repository will serve as the foundation for our collaborative project during the event. Stay tuned for updates as we finalize our idea and begin building our custom Odoo solution.
